The provided input appears to have malformed file paths and missing information. The modified file is listed as just '"Ink' which doesn't follow standard file naming conventions, and there's no current .gitignore content provided in the format expected.

Based on the information given, I cannot determine appropriate ignore patterns since there are no clear build artifacts, dependency directories, or other ignorable files identified in the changes.
