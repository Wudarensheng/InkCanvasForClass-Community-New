The provided input shows modified files with unusual names containing quotes: `'\"Ink'`. This appears to be a data formatting issue rather than actual file paths. Since there are no clear build artifacts, dependency directories, or temporary files listed in the changes, and the file names seem corrupted, no specific ignore rules can be determined from this input.

Based on rule #6, when the change list doesn't contain clear build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, the output should be empty.
